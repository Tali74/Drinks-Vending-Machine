# Drinks-Vending-Machine
<h1>Instructions</h1>
<div>
Write a simple (Graphical) application that simulates a hot-drinks vending machine.
The machine should offer different types of hot drinks, (e.g. tea, coffee, chocolate drink etc.), each with its own name, price and preparation method.
Clients choose their preferred drink, pay, and the machine should prepare it.
New drinks are added to the machine from time to time. Build a general mechanism to support these adaptations.
Use a Graphical User Interface to your system.
